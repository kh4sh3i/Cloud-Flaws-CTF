# Cloud Flaws CTF
flAWS.cloud and flAWS2.cloud Interactive tutorial/CTFs to learn common AWS security mistakes.

## [FlAWS challenge](https://github.com/kh4sh3i/Cloud-Flaws-CTF/tree/main/flaws.cloud):
Through a series of levels you'll learn about common mistakes and gotchas when using Amazon Web Services (AWS). There are no SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflows, or many of the other vulnerabilities you might have seen before. As much as possible, these are AWS specific issues.


## [FlAWS2 challenge](https://github.com/kh4sh3i/Cloud-Flaws-CTF/tree/main/flaws2.cloud) :
Welcome to the flAWS 2 challenge! Similar to the original flAWS.cloud (also created by Summit Route), this game/tutorial teaches you AWS (Amazon Web Services) security concepts. The challenges are focused on AWS specific issues, so no buffer overflows, XSS, etc. You can play by getting hands-on-keyboard or just click through the hints to learn the concepts and go from one level to the next without playing.
